This is going to be my first web development project through the odin project. I'm hoping to be able to make a clone (or close enought clone) of the google search homepage. 

If you want to try this project out as well, then go to The Odin Project via this link http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css
